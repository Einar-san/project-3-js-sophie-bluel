# project-3-js-sophie-bluel

This readme provides instructions on how to set up and run the project-3-js-sophie-bluel. Please follow these steps carefully to ensure a smooth experience.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: You can download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

## Installation

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the `Backend` directory of the project.

2. Run the following command to install the backend dependencies:

```bash
    npm install
```

3. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the server by running:

 ```bash
    npm start
```

This will launch the backend server, and it will be accessible at a specified address.

4. Next, you'll need to serve the frontend files. Open your integrated development environment (IDE) and locate the `index.html` file in the `Frontend` directory of the project.

5. Use your IDE's built-in functionality to serve the `index.html` file. Typically, this is done by right-clicking the file and selecting an option like "Open with Live Server" or "Run in Browser."

6. After starting the frontend server, you should be able to access your project in your web browser, and everything should be functioning correctly.

## Usage

At this point, you should have both the backend and frontend servers running, allowing you to interact with the project. If you encounter any issues or have questions, refer to the project documentation or seek assistance from the project team.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any problems during installation or setup, please make sure to:

- Double-check that you have all the prerequisites installed correctly.

- Ensure that the backend server is running and accessible at the specified address.

- Verify that the frontend server is serving the `index.html` file properly.
